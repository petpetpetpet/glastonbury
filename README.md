# Glastonbury Ticket Info
Here's the main bits in point form:
- The URL where tickets will be sold: https://glastonbury.seetickets.com
- The URL of our spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q3bjpcGDEczZPvBhhwnJRlhvdF3kyfzp66nDWggzY7Q/edit?usp=sharing
- Payment:
    - Credit Card: VISA or MASTERCARD only.
    - Debit: UK cards only. If you don't have one, use a credit card.
    - You will need £50 on your card per person you register, so for a group of 6, if you get through, you will need to pay £300.
    - Obviously you get paid back right after.
    - Work out which card, and if you need to borrow a card number from someone sort it out in advance.
- Dates and Times: 
    - 9am GMT - 6-Nov-2022.

# How Does it Work
ANYONE can head to https://glastonbury.seetickets.com and try for tickets, as many times as they like. IF someone is lucky enough to get through, they will be presented with a form that lets them enter up to SIX registration numbers and post codes. They do not need to enter their own.

*Process*:
1. Keep refreshing the ticket site until you get in.
2. IF YOU GET THROUGH - Enter the registration numbers from your group. You have 5 minutes to do this.
3. Proceed to payment. Pay the £50 deposit for each person.
4. Once paid ANNOUNCE TO THE WHATSAPP GROUP that you have done this. 
5. Now return to trying for tickets, and if you get through, get tickets for another group.

- 4 is important - it lets everyone know that your group is sorted and that people should try for other groups.
- You can still get through and buy tickets for other groups even if you bought your own group tickets. You can put anyone's reg in.

# What to Expect
The site will probably freeze up. Repeatedly show you garbage, or otherwise seem like it aint working. This is normal. Just keep trying. Stay calm, and dont panic else you'll put in the wrong numbers or something.

# Phone or Laptop
Using an actual computer is preferred, its much easier to copy and paste from the sheet into the form.
That being said, we've gotten tickets through people's phones before, it's just more challenging to switch to google apps, copy a number, then switch back to safari to paste it.


# Glamping etc
This happens later on in the day. Process is basically the same.
