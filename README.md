# Glastonbury Coach Ticket Info
Here's some info, primarily for the people who have not been through the Glastonbury ticket buying fiasco before.
## TL;DR
Thursday, 3rd Oct @ 6pm, start visiting this website to reserve a ticket: [https://glastonbury.seetickets.com](https://glastonbury.seetickets.com/content/extras)

You can buy 6 tickets every time you get through. All groups have 5 people, **so fill the 6th slot with someone from another group**.

Announce when you get tickets to the thread (and tell us who your 6th person was.)

Get tickets for London Wembley or London Vic bus station, Wed or Thursday whatever time you can get.
Make sure you have about £650 on the card you're using to pay. Ask to borrow someone's card details if you've not got it.

# In Detail
## How it Works
The Glastonbury ticket buying page lets you reserve 6 tickets at a time. The aim is to keep refreshing the ticket URL until you get through and are able to buy tickets for your group. If you or someone else already managed to get your group's tickets, keep going, and try to buy tickets for another group.

*If you get a group's tickets, announce it in the thread (and who your 6th person was), so everyone knows that they should move on to another group.*

## When do tickets go on sale?
- First round: 6pm on Thursday 3rd Oct.

- Second round: 9am on Sunday 6th Oct.

  Be on front of some sort of internet connected device 5-10 mins before those times so you're ready to start the scramble.

## Why do our groups only have 5 people
Because there were 20 of us. If you get through **use your sixth slot to put in a person of your choice from one of the other groups.** You might want to decide who this is in advance to reduce your task load while on the ticket page. 
## What to Expect
Most of the time, when you try to visit the ticket purchase page, you'll get no response, or a holding page. Don't despair. Keep refreshing, this is normal.

If you get through prepare to have to do the following under time pressure: choose a bus station, departure time, enter your group + 1 person's numbers and postcodes, and your card details to reserve the tickets. Breathe.

Coach tickets will probably sell out in 5 minutes.

## Which Coach Stop to Choose?
There are two stops in London:
- London Wembley
- London Victoria
Either are fine. Choose whichever you see first. Only backtrack if the station you choose has no reasonable bus times left.
## Single or Return
Decide with your group, otherwise: Prioritise single, check return if nothing's available.
## Which Time to Choose
Decide this with your group. Otherwise: Prioritise Wed afternoon, with Thursday being completely acceptable.
The time slots disappear super fast, so it's sort of a take what you can get situation. Trying to backtrack and browse other timeslots will waste time and lose you more slots - so it's good to decide in advance with your group what to target.
## Payment
Have a card with £650 available on it. (£50 ticket deposit + £30-£54 (it varies year on year) coach ticket multiplied by 6 people.) You'll need to pay for everyone's deposit and bus ticket if you get through (historically everyone has paid us back their bits within the same hour.)
## Phone or Laptop?
It's easier to copy and paste from the spreadsheet into the reservation page using a laptop. Phone does work though, and we've gotten tickets that way before (so if you cannot be at a computer on the day, use your phone.)
